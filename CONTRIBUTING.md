### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- [Good First Issue](https://github.com/Vaporjawn/universities/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/Vaporjawn/universities/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### Pull Requests

- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Follow the [TypeScript styleguide](#typescript-styleguide)
- Include thoughtful comments in your code
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- End all files with a newline
- Avoid platform-dependent code

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over raw promises when possible
- Handle errors appropriately (don't swallow them)
- Write pure functions when possible
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use proper TypeScript types, avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary
- Export types that are part of the public API

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Searches for universities matching the given criteria
 * @param options - Search options including filters and pagination
 * @returns Array of matching universities
 */
export function searchUniversities(options: UniversitySearchOptions): University[] {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation
- Reference functions, classes, and modules in backticks: \`UniversityScraper\`
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments

## Ethical Considerations

### Web Scraping Ethics

This project includes web scraping functionality. When contributing to scraping-related features:

- **Respect robots.txt**: Always check and honor robots.txt directives
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement and respect rate limits to avoid overloading servers
- **User-Agent**: Use a descriptive User-Agent that identifies the bot and provides contact information
- **Caching**: Implement proper caching to avoid redundant requests
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and implement backoff strategies
- **Terms of Service**: Consider the terms of service of websites being scraped
- **Privacy**: Do not scrape or store personal data beyond institutional metadata
- **Transparency**: Document what data is being collected and how it's used

### Conservative Defaults

- Default to lower concurrency settings
- Implement delays between requests
- Provide clear documentation on responsible usage
- Add warnings for bulk operations

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high test coverage (currently targeting 30%+ for critical paths)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test edge cases and error conditions
